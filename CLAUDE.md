# March Madness on Seismic

## Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

1. **After every change**, update `README.md` and this `CLAUDE.md` if the change affects documented behavior, architecture, or setup.
2. **Every PR** must include a changeset file. Run `bunx changeset` to create one in `.changeset/`. Do NOT edit `docs/changeset.md` directly — it is auto-generated on merge by the `merge-changesets` workflow.
3. **Every prompt** from the user must be saved verbatim to `docs/prompts/<branch-name>/` as a `.txt` file. Filename format: `{timestamp-seconds}-{slug}.txt`. Organize by feature branch name.
4. **When submitting PRs**, write them in the chat for user review. User may leave comments here or on GitHub.
5. **Branch strategy**: Be intentional about what branch you're working off of. Usually `main`, but agents may stack on each other when dependencies exist.
6. **All git branches** must be prefixed with `cdai__` (e.g., `cdai__add-contracts`).
7. **Every task ends with a PR**. After completing work, push the branch and open a PR. GitHub is source of truth — no code goes to main without review.
8. **`scripts/ci.sh` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` must stay in sync.** If you change one, update the other. The local script mirrors the GitHub workflow exactly so you can validate before pushing.
9. **Run `./scripts/ci.sh` locally before pushing any commits or opening PRs.** CI must pass locally first. No exceptions. If you break CI, fix it before pushing.

> **Keep in sync**: Whenever you add or change anything in this Rules checklist, also update the skill at `.claude/skills/checklist/SKILL.md`.

## Tech Stack

### Contracts

- **Language**: Seismic Solidity (ssolc) — the only shielded type we use is `sbytes8` for bracket storage. All other data is unshielded (use normal Solidity types).
- **Framework**: sforge (seismic foundry fork) for build, test, deploy
- **Local node**: sanvil (seismic anvil fork)
- **Key pattern**: `sbytes8` values are shielded on-chain; nodes won't reveal underlying values unless contract explicitly exposes them

### TypeScript / Frontend

- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Blockchain client**: seismic-viem (peer dep: viem)
- **React hooks**: seismic-react (peer deps: wagmi, @tanstack/react-query)
- **Auth**: Privy (Twitter, Discord, social logins → embedded wallet)
- **Build**: Vite
- **UI**: React + Tailwind CSS

### Rust (Crates)

- **indexer**: Listens for on-chain events (MarchMadness, BracketGroups, BracketMirror), writes to Redis
- **server**: Serves indexed data from Redis via HTTP (entries, groups, mirrors, tournament status, forecasts)
- **ncaa-api**: NCAA basketball API client (scoreboard + schedule + bracket, rate-limited)
- **ncaa-feed**: Polls NCAA API, maps games to bracket indices, writes tournament status to Redis (`mm:games` key). Also contains `fetch-bracket` binary for populating `tournament.json` from the NCAA bracket API.

```

## KenPom CSV Format

`data/{year}/men/kenpom.csv` has **one row per team** — First Four teams each get their own row with individual KenPom metrics. No squished/averaged rows.

- **Columns**: `team,ortg,drtg,pace[,goose]` — goose is optional (defaults to 0.0)
- **First Four handling**: `load_teams_from_json` (in `bracket-sim/src/team.rs`) looks up each individual FF team in the kenpom map and averages their metrics for the 64-team bracket slot. This is the only place averaging happens.
- **Calibration round-trip**: `save_kenpom_csv_with_goose` reads the original kenpom.csv, updates only goose values (using `ff_to_slot` mapping from tournament.json to apply slot goose to both FF teams), and preserves individual metrics.
- **Kalshi calibration**: First Four teams are **excluded** from Kalshi market-making calibration. Kalshi has separate individual markets per FF team, not a joint market for the bracket slot. Including them would produce nonsense combined-name URLs and incorrect edge signals. FF teams conservatively keep goose=0.
- **Re-scraping**: `python scripts/scrape_kenpom.py --bracket-only` outputs individual rows. Name mappings in `data/mappings.toml`.

## Embedded Data

The `seismic-march-madness` crate embeds tournament data at compile time via `include_str!` for all available years (currently 2025 and 2026 men's). This is primarily for **external consumers** who import the crate without access to the repo's data files. Internal crates like `bracket-sim` continue reading from the filesystem. `forecaster` and `ncaa-feed` use embedded data as a convenience (they already depend on the crate). CLI flags (`--tournament-file`, `--input`, etc.) still work as overrides.

Key accessors (year-parameterized, no defaults):

- `TournamentData::embedded(year)` — parse embedded tournament JSON for the given year
- `KenpomRatings::embedded(year)` — parse embedded KenPom CSV for the given year
- `tournament_json(year)` / `kenpom_csv(year)` — raw `Option<&'static str>` accessors

## Contract Interface (MarchMadness.sol)

Constructor: `MarchMadness(uint16 year, uint256 entryFee, uint256 submissionDeadline)`

Key functions:

- `submitBracket(sbytes8 bracket)` — submit shielded bracket, 1 ETH buy-in
- `updateBracket(sbytes8 bracket)` — update bracket before deadline
- `setTag(string tag)` — set/update optional display name (separate from bracket submission)
- `hasEntry(address)` → `bool` — public mapping, true if address has submitted. No signed read needed.
- `getBracket(address account)` → `bytes8` — before deadline: requires msg.sender == account (signed read); after deadline: anyone can read
- `submitResults(bytes8 results)` — owner only, posts tournament results. Must be called within `RESULTS_DEADLINE` (90 days) of the submission deadline.
- `scoreBracket(address account)` — score a bracket against results (after results posted, within `SCORING_DURATION` of results)
- `collectWinnings()` — winners collect after scoring window closes
- `collectEntryFee()` — entrants reclaim entry fee if owner fails to post results within the 90-day window (no-contest escape hatch)
- `getEntryCount()` → `uint32` — number of entries (capped at uint32 max with overflow check)

Events:

- `BracketSubmitted(address indexed account)` — emitted on submit AND update

## BracketMirror Contract (BracketMirror.sol)

Standalone admin-managed off-chain bracket pool mirror. No money, no scoring, no composition with MarchMadness. All winner computation happens off-chain.

- `createMirror(slug, displayName)` → mirrorId
- `addEntry(mirrorId, bracket, slug)` — admin adds `MirrorEntry { bracket, slug }`; slug must be unique within mirror
- `removeEntry(mirrorId, index)` — swap-and-pop
- `updateBracket(mirrorId, index, bracket)` / `updateEntrySlug(mirrorId, index, slug)`
- `setPrizeDescription(mirrorId, description)` — off-chain prize bookkeeping
- `getEntryBySlug(mirrorId, slug)` — lookup entry by slug for nice URLs (e.g. `/mirrors/mens-league/brackets/my-entry-slug`)
- Entries stored as `MirrorEntry[]` array per mirror
- Existence check: `admin != address(0)` (no `exists` field)

## BracketGroups Contract (BracketGroups.sol)

Linked sub-groups composing with MarchMadness. Optional password + entry fee.

- `createGroup(slug, displayName, entryFee)` → groupId (public, payable — creator auto-joined with name "CREATOR")
- `createGroupWithPassword(slug, displayName, entryFee, sbytes12 password)` → groupId (private, payable — creator auto-joined with name "CREATOR")
- `joinGroup(groupId, name)` / `joinGroupWithPassword(groupId, sbytes12 password, name)` — payable, always requires name
- `leaveGroup(groupId)` — refund before submission deadline
- `editEntryName(groupId, name)` — update display name
- `scoreEntry(groupId, memberIndex)` — delegates to `marchMadness.scoreBracket()` if not already scored, then reads score
- `collectWinnings(groupId)` — winners split group prize pool after scoring window
- `getGroupBySlug(slug)` → `(uint32, Group memory)` — returns both ID and group data

Password stored as `sbytes12` (shielded). Public groups reject password joins and vice versa.
Group IDs are `uint32`. GroupPayout uses `uint32` for numWinners/numScored.
BracketGroups imports `IMarchMadness` interface (not the full contract) — field named `marchMadness`.
Group struct uses `creator` (not `admin`) since group creators have no extra privileges.
Existence check: `creator != address(0)` (no `exists` field).

## Deploy Scripts

Single deploy script deploys all 3 contracts. BracketGroups receives the MarchMadness address in its constructor.

- **Production**: `contracts/script/DeployAll.s.sol` — deploys MM + Groups + Mirror
- **Local dev**: `contracts/script/DeployAllLocal.s.sol` — same with configurable `DEADLINE_OFFSET`
- **Testnet**: `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh` — runs `DeployAll.s.sol`, writes all 3 addresses to `data/deployments.json`
- **Mirror-only**: `contracts/script/DeployMirror.s.sol` + `scripts/redeploy-mirror.sh` — redeploy BracketMirror without touching MM or Groups
- **Legacy scripts**: `MarchMadness.s.sol` / `MarchMadnessLocal.s.sol` still work for MM-only deploys

`data/deployments.json` format: `{ "2026": { "5124": { "marchMadness": "0x...", "bracketGroups": "0x...", "bracketMirror": "0x..." } } }`

## Bracket Encoding

- 64 bits (bytes8): bit 63 = MSB (sentinel, must be 1), bits 62-0 = 63 game outcomes
- This is identical to jimpo's original bytes8 encoding — no changes needed to his ByteBracket scoring library
- Scoring: jimpo's ByteBracket library (bit-level scoring, max score 192)
- Teams ordered by region, seeded [1,16,8,9,5,12,4,13,6,11,3,14,7,10,2,15] per region

## Server API

Rust HTTP server (`crates/server`, default port 3000). All data is read from Redis. Routes have NO `/api` prefix — nginx adds that in production.

- `GET /entries` — full entry index (from Redis)
- `GET /entries/:address` — single entry by address
- `GET /stats` — total entries + scored count
- `GET /groups` — list all groups (from Redis)
- `GET /groups/:slug` — group details by slug
- `GET /groups/:slug/members` — group member addresses
- `GET /address/:address/groups` — groups an address belongs to (from `mm:address_groups` reverse mapping)
- `GET /mirrors` — list all mirrors (from Redis)
- `GET /mirrors/:slug` — mirror details by slug
- `GET /mirrors/:slug/entries` — mirror entries (slug → bracket)
- `GET /tournament-status` — tournament status JSON (from Redis `mm:games` key)
- `GET /forecasts` — main pool win probabilities in basis points (from Redis HASH `mm:forecasts` field `"mm"`)
- `GET /forecasts/groups/s/:slug` — group forecast by slug (basis points)
- `GET /forecasts/groups/id/:id` — group forecast by ID (basis points)
- `GET /forecasts/mirrors/s/:slug` — mirror forecast by slug (basis points)
- `GET /forecasts/mirrors/id/:id` — mirror forecast by ID (basis points)
- `GET /team-probs` — per-team advance probabilities (from Redis HASH `mm:probs`, written by forecaster)
- `GET /health` — health check

Requires Redis (`REDIS_URL` env var, default `redis://127.0.0.1:6379`).

Frontend env var `VITE_API_BASE` sets the server URL (default `http://localhost:3000`).

Production URL: `https://brackets.seismictest.net/api/...` (nginx proxies `/api/*` to port 3000).
See `docs/api.md` for full API documentation including schema, game index layout, and team names.

## Frontend Routes

- `/` — Home: bracket picker (pre-deadline) or own bracket with tournament overlay (post-deadline)
- `/leaderboard` — All entries ranked by `scoreBracketPartial` (current score, max possible)
- `/groups/:slug/leaderboard` — Group-scoped leaderboard (reuses `LeaderboardPage` with member filtering via `useGroupMembers` hook)
- `/groups` — Groups hub: mobile uses tab layout (Your Groups, Public Groups, Join Group, Create Group); desktop uses 2-column layout with Create/Join forms on left, Your Groups + link to public groups on right
- `/groups/public` — Browse public groups (dedicated page, linked from desktop hub)
- `/bracket/:address` — Read-only bracket view with tournament status overlay

## Shielded Types & Security

- Brackets stored as `sbytes8` (shielded) — hidden until deadline passes
- `getBracket()` is the most security-critical function: MUST validate `msg.sender == account` before deadline
- Use `walletClient.writeContract()` (shielded write) for submissions, NOT `.twriteContract()`
- Use signed reads (`walletClient.readContract()`) to read own bracket before deadline
- After deadline, client should use `.treadContract()` since brackets are publicly readable

## Environment

Single `.env` file at repo root — see `.env.example` for all variables. Never create `.env` files in subdirectories.

- **Vite** loads from root via `envDir: "../../"` in `packages/web/vite.config.ts`
- **Testnet deploy** (`bun deploy:testnet`) sources `.env` for `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` and `VITE_RPC_URL`, deploys via sforge, and writes the contract address to `data/deployments.json`
- **Contract address resolution**: `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` CLI override → `data/deployments.json` (checked-in, keyed by year + chain ID) → zero address fallback
- **Local dev** (populate script) uses hardcoded anvil accounts from `data/anvil-accounts.json` — does not need `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`
- **Redis**: `REDIS_URL` env var (default `redis://127.0.0.1:6379`). Used by indexer and server for chain metadata storage.

## Local Development

### Populate Script (`packages/localdev/src/populate.ts`)

Spawns a sanvil node (if not already running), deploys the MarchMadness contract via sforge, populates it with data for the requested phase, then starts the Vite dev server with the contract address injected automatically. Use `--no-vite` to skip starting Vite (e.g. for CI or scripting).

Three phases:

- **`pre-submission`** (default) — deploys contract with future deadline (1 hour). No brackets submitted. Use for testing bracket picker UI and submission flow.
- **`post-submission`** — deploys, submits brackets from anvil test accounts, fast-forwards past deadline, posts results, scores first 3 brackets. Use for testing bracket viewing, scoring UI, off-chain preview. Remaining brackets are left unscored for manual testing.
- **`post-grading`** — full lifecycle: deploy, submit, score all, fast-forward past scoring window. Use for testing payout collection and final leaderboard.

```bash
bun p:pre                     # pre-submission (default)
bun p:post                    # post-submission: brackets + results + partial scoring
bun p:grading                 # post-grading: full lifecycle including payouts
```

Key env vars: `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` (skip deploy), `DEADLINE_OFFSET` (custom deadline), `RPC_URL`.

### Seed Command (`cargo run -p march-madness-indexer -- seed`)

Writes fake data directly to Redis for local frontend development. No chain or RPC needed — Redis only. Generates random entries (with brackets and tags), a mid-tournament status (24 final + 3 live games + team reach probabilities), 3 sample groups with members, and 2 sample mirrors with entries. Requires `DANGEROUSLY_SEED_REDIS=1` env var as a safety guard (never set on production).

```bash
DANGEROUSLY_SEED_REDIS=1 cargo run -p march-madness-indexer -- seed              # 50 entries (default)
DANGEROUSLY_SEED_REDIS=1 cargo run -p march-madness-indexer -- seed --entries 100 # custom count
DANGEROUSLY_SEED_REDIS=1 cargo run -p march-madness-indexer -- seed --clean       # clear seeded keys first
```

After seeding, run the forecaster to generate per-pool win probabilities and team advance probs, then start the server:

```bash
cargo run -p march-madness-forecaster          # writes mm:forecasts + mm:probs to Redis
cargo run -p march-madness-server              # serves data from Redis
cd packages/web && bun dev                     # start frontend
```

### Integration Tests (`packages/localdev/test/integration.test.ts`)

Runs against an already-running sanvil node (started externally, e.g. by CI or the populate script). Deploys via sforge, then tests the full contract lifecycle.

```bash
bun run --filter @march-madness/localdev test
```

Tests cover the full contract lifecycle (submit, update, deadline enforcement, scoring, payouts) using the client library against a live sanvil node.

## Key Dates

- **Bracket lock**: Thursday March 19, 2026 at 12:15 PM EST (1773940500 unix)
- **No-contest deadline**: 28 days after results posted
- **Entry fee**: 0.1 ETH (testnet)

## Error Handling

- **Use rich error types** — don't swallow errors to `String`. Use `#[from]` with `thiserror` to preserve original error types (e.g. `reqwest::Error`, `serde_json::Error`). Structured error variants (e.g. `HttpStatus { status, url }`) are better than `Http(String)`.
- **Propagate errors** — prefer `?` and `Result` over `unwrap_or_default()` when missing data indicates a real problem. If the NCAA API returns empty data, that's an error worth surfacing.

## Seismic RPC Quirks

- **Block timestamps**: Seismic RPC returns **millisecond** timestamps (e.g. via `eth_getBlockByNumber`), but Solidity's `block.timestamp` is still in **seconds**. If you read block timestamps from JS via the RPC, divide by 1000.
