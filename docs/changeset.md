## [Unreleased]

### 2026-03-14 — Client Library (`packages/client`)
- Added `src/abi.ts` — MarchMadness contract ABI as const array (uses bytes8 for shielded types, seismic-viem handles shielding)
- Added `src/client.ts` — three-level client hierarchy:
  - `MarchMadnessPublicClient`: transparent reads (entry count, results, deadline, scores, tags)
  - `MarchMadnessUserClient`: shielded writes (submitBracket, updateBracket), signed reads (getMyBracket), transparent writes (setTag, scoreBracket, collectWinnings)
  - `MarchMadnessOwnerClient`: owner-only functions (submitResults)
- Added `src/format.ts` — human-readable bracket formatting (formatBracketLines, formatBracketJSON, getFinalFourSummary, getTeamAdvancements)
- Added `validateBracket(hex)` to `src/bracket.ts` — checks 0x prefix, hex length, and sentinel bit
- Fixed runner-up detection bug in `decodeBracket` — now correctly identifies the Final Four loser
- Updated `src/index.ts` barrel exports for all new modules
- Added tests: `abi.test.ts` (5 tests), `format.test.ts` (7 tests), expanded `bracket.test.ts` (8 new tests for validateBracket + runner-up)
- 25 total tests passing, typecheck clean

### 2026-03-14 — Rust HTTP Server (`crates/server`)
- Built `march-madness-server` HTTP server using axum + tokio
- Endpoints: `GET /api/entries` (full index), `GET /api/entries/:address` (single entry), `GET /api/stats` (total entries + scored count), `GET /health`
- TTL-cached reads of the indexer's JSON file (5s default) with fs2 shared/read file locks
- CORS enabled (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *) for frontend access
- CLI via clap: `--port` (default 3001) and `--index-file` (default `data/entries.json`)
- Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- Structured logging via tracing

### 2026-03-14 — CI Workflows + Local CI Script (mise-based)
- Added `mise.toml` (root) — pins sfoundry (nightly), ssolc (2ebb36d), bun (1.3.9) via mise, mirroring samlaf's setup in the seismic repo
- Added `contracts/mise.toml` — sforge tasks (build, test, fmt-check) with FOUNDRY_SOLC injection
- Added `packages/mise.toml` — bun tasks (typecheck, lint, build, test) for client and web
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — uses `jdx/mise-action@v2` for contracts and packages, cargo directly for crates, changeset enforcement on PRs
- Added `scripts/ci.sh` — local mirror of GitHub CI using mise, run before pushing
- Initialized crates workspace (common lib + indexer/server bins) and packages workspace (client + web + tests)
- Added CLAUDE.md rules #7 (every task ends with PR), #8 (ci.sh ↔ ci.yml sync), #9 (run CI locally before pushing)

### 2026-03-14 — Smart Contracts
- Added ByteBracket.sol library: ported jimpo's bit-manipulation scoring algorithm to Solidity 0.8 with bytes8 (unchecked blocks for bit ops)
- Added MarchMadness.sol main contract: shielded bracket storage (sbytes8), submit/update/score/payout lifecycle
- 57 tests pass with sforge

### 2026-03-14 — Initial Project Setup
- Created repo structure: contracts/, packages/, crates/, data/, docs/
- Added CLAUDE.md with project rules and architecture
- Added README.md with credits to jimpo and pursuingpareto (ByteBracket algorithm author)
- Tournament data in jimpo's format (name, teams, regions) — data/mens-2026.json
- Saved initial prompts to docs/prompts/
